# Is your strategic project an abusive client relationship in hiding?

I've worked at both product companies and service companies, as well as freelance and I've heard this quote everywhere I've worked (as well as in my own head):

> We're taking on this project [that no one wants to do, and the client/customer isn't paying us well for] for the long term.  We'll build the relationship and then cash in once we build up the trust and they start giving us the _good_ projects.

As an _in the trenches_ engineer, this is a battle cry I'll gladly get behind.  I love working on the _right project_ with the _right people_.  And, for me, I've got no problem sacrificing on the short-term to focus on the long-term.

### At what point does a strategic project turn into an abusive relationship?

It's hard to know you're in one of these relationships, because it rarely starts out that way, and it feels like the other side still wants it to work out... we just have to wait sufficiently long.

I don't have any concrete advice for detecting when the relationship is turning upside down, but here are some smells:

* __ALL__ _workers_ on the project bitch and moan about it... for good reason.
* We let the client pay well under market value.
* We've never seen one of these elusive _good_ projects.
* We're too busy _taking orders_ to innovate.

Sometimes it's hard to sever a relationship like this.  Especially when you have great rapport and trust with the actual people on the other side.  That being said, this proverb always comes to mind for me:

> No matter how far you have gone on the wrong road, you can always turn back.
