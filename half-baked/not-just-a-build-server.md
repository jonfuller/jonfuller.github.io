In the early days of CI (for me), it was interchangeable with the word build-server.  I find this to be true many times today as well.  On my own projects no less!

After reading the [CI book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321336380/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321336380&linkCode=as2&tag=sansblo0d-20) I realized how few o the benefits of CI I was taking advantage of by only using the CI server as a build server!

inspection
staged builds
fast feedback
CI in the "large"
