A couple years ago a [colleague](http://mdswanson.com/) and I started hacking our enterprise.  We wanted a developer friendly way to ask questions about [SEP](http://www.sep.com) and the people who work here.

We called it the SEP [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api).

Something like:

    $ curl GET /hired/jcfuller
    
    200/OK
    {
      username: 'jcfuller',
      school: 'Rose-Hulman',
      hiredate: '2008-02-04'
    }

After many months of tracking down data sources (not the HR file cabinet) we had some data, so I wrote up a little sinatra app to serve it.

    get '/hired/:username => [username]
      JSON.load('data.json')[username].to_json
    end

In the meantime, we harvested some data from other sources too, like Active Directory so we could do things like:

    $ curl GET /sepeer/jcfuller
    
    200/OK
    {
      username: 'jcfuller',
      email: 'jcfuller@sep.com'
      title: 'Lead Software Engineer',
      first: 'Jonathon',
      middle: 'C',
      last: 'Fuller',
      extension: 1234
    }

## So what's the point?

We have a treasure trove of data about the company that needs to be surfaced and talked about.  Once this data is in a developer friendly format (e.g. JSON web API), we can make anything we want from it.  Like the following dashboard that now lives in our commons/breakroom...

And now we can do things like:

* build an app (and we did!) containing the company directory that you can call or text anyone from your smartphone
* build a trivia game that helps you match names with faces
* tell recruits that 49 of our 106 employees attended their school ([Rose-Hulman](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/))
* or that our retention rate is 96%
* play with new [patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture), [practices](http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-delivery), [tools](https://www.flowdock.com), and [technologies](http://www.mongodb.org/) that we don't get to use every day

Culture hacks like these become increasingly important as our ogranization continues to grow larger. It helps us to keep [SEP](http://www.sep.com) feeling like a small company and to keep it so we can all know each other, and remember where we came from.
